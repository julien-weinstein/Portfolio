    "We've provided you a dataset where some instances have labels, but most labels are missing. In this question, you'll use label propagation methods from semi-supervised learning to infer the missing labels. The application is classification: the general goal of this question is to answer: was semi-supervised learning using label propagation successful at improving the accuracy of this question's classifier?\n",

    "\n",
    "A professor and lab assistants spend months manually classifying cancer cells as benign or malignant, and gathering a set of descriptive features based on their visual properties. Their goal is to use support vector machines to predict whether a cancer cell is benign or malignant based on its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "After painstakingly analyzing and sorting the lab samples into boxes of benign and malignant groups, the clumsy professor accidently spills a mug of artisanal, locally-sourced dark roast Arabica coffee all over the vials, erasing most of their benign/malignant labels. (Each vial and its label represent one data instance.) To add insult to injury, in trying to avoid the coffee the professor knocks the boxes to the floor and the benign/malignant groups get completely mixed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the trajectory of the coffee relative to the boxes, the professor estimates these probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability a benign (non-malignant) cell vial (instance) had its label erased: 30%\n",
    "Probability a malignant cell vial (instance) had its label erased : 90%\n",
    "\n",
    "Their paper to the journal \"Annals of Overfitting and Data Leakage\" is due tomorrow. There are two choices they have for training their classifier and they want to maximize accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "`METHOD 1.` Throw away any vials whose labels were erased, and train the classifier ONLY on the much smaller but complete and accurate labeled data that remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "`METHOD 2.` Attempt to use semi-supervised learning to reconstitute the missing labels, and then train the classifier on that \"reconstituted\" dataset. An insightful colleague, an instructor for the SIADS 543 course, suggests using a label propagation algorithm in scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal for this question is to train a classifier for each of methods 1 and 2 to see how semi-supervised learning can affect classifier performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before you do that, run the code below to initialize the raw training and test sets. Then, instead of spilling hot coffee, you're going to simulate the label destruction by calling the provided function get_mangled_label_dataset(). \n"

    "## Question 2 (40 points total)\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in this week's lecture on how unsupervised learning can help supervised learning, `covariate shift` is the name of a phenomenon in which the underlying distribution of the features for the data instances being classified using a trained model is different from the underlying distribution of the data originally used to train the classifier. This is a critical problem since the normal machine learning paradigm of estimating generalization error by minimizing test error on held-out data assumes that any future data instances to be classified are drawn from the same underlying distribution as the data used to train/test the classifier. If this assumption doesn't hold, it means your classifier may be out of date, probably giving worse predictions over time, and in need of retraining. (I use the term \"classifier\" here but the same applies if you're training/evaluating a regressor.)  Note that covariate shift is different than 'concept drift' which refers to how a *label* definition may change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many methods for detecting covariate shift. In this question we will use a simple one based on the methods you've already seen in week 1 for density estimation, and in this week's discussion (in the EM lecture) on Gaussian mixture models (GMM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: You have set up an online business selling wine. As part of a site recommender system, you build a regression model that can predict the likely user quality rating for a wine based on several features. These features summarize some of the wine's various quantitative properties (e.g. alcohol % by volume, taste rating, level of sulfites, and other chemical properties) which are provided as part of an analysis by the supplier. Your regression algorithm will try to predict the customers' perceived quality of the wine, which in turn will help you predict possible future demand and also set the wine price accordingly. Your original training data comes from the current set of wines provided by your supplier, plus labels that you gathered (in a time consuming, expensive process) from online customer ratings and in-person tasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't need detailed knowledge of the features to use this data, but in case you're curious, each instance of a wine has the following real-valued features:\n",

    "Not only will a scikit-learn Imputer object fill in the missing values of the input dataset, but setting the Imputer option `add_indicator=True` will cause extra binary indicator features to be added to the imputed dataset: a set of binary variables, one per original feature, for remembering which features *in that row* were imputed. Why would this be useful?  It's useful because if the values are *not* missing completely at random and e.g. are related to the range of a variable -- for example, if people with higher incomes are less likely to reveal them in a survey -- then by adding these extra binary features, the classifier has at least a chance for learning something about the relationship of how the 'missingness' might relate to the target value. In other words, the very fact that a value is missing can tell the classifier at least something potentially about its range or distribution, which might be useful for learning. \n",

    "In case you're curious, we have designed a \"missing not completely at random\" (i.e conditionally random) dataset below based on the mean value in each column: the likelihood of a missing value increases with the variable magnitude. \n",

    "The purpose of this question is to see what the effect is on classifier accuracy in such a scenario from setting add_indicator = True to add those extra binary indicator features.

With this composite pipeline estimator, compute the mean five-fold cross-validation classifier score on the X_missing dataset.\n",
